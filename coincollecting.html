				<b>I love to collect coins. It all started when I found out about a penny that was worth more than a million dollars. <a target="blank"href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/rare-1943-lincoln-penny-sells-for-1-million">Rare 1943 Lincoln penny sells for $1 million | Fox News</a> Who wouldn't want that? I decided to check all of my coins. I didn't find the penny, but I was already hooked. Then my brother got a coin collecting book, and as I was looking through it, I was intrigued at how many different types of coins there are. But that was only the start. I collected the <a draggable="true" href="releasedatesforstatequarters.odt">State</a> and <a draggable="true" href="releasedatesfornationalparks.docx">National Park Quarters</a>. I collected pennies from 1959-2008, and tons of other types of coins. I even wrote a booklet about all of the different coins and when they came out! Here is a link for that booklet:<a draggable="true" href="historyofUScoins.odt"> A history of US coins</a> I haven't gotten a coin that is worth millions of dollars yet, but some of my coins are worth one hundred dollars or more, and I got them for their face value! Plus, coin collecting is fun, and worthwhile. I love to look through piles of coins and find something to add to my coin collection. I love to collect coins, and so should you!
